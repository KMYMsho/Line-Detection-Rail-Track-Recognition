opcv_video_edge.py: shows the real time line detection	

opencv_edges_lines_video.py: shows result of the test videos on the screen wihtout saving

opencv_edges_lines_video_record.py: record and save the result of the video test

Videoes for testing:
railroad_video1.mp4,
railroad_video2.mp4,
railroad_video3.mp4,
